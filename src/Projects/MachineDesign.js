				During my Machine Design course, we were assigned three design problems to solve.
				Prior to this class, I had no experience designing mechanical objects with a
				structured approach or with much engineering backing my decisions.
				This was one of my favorite classes in college, as it brought me from someone
				who did not know how to properly design something to someone who feels comfortable
				with their foundational skills and excited to apply them. Big thank you to Dr.
				David Smith (aka Alpha), a supportive and rigorous professor.

						The design problems were practical â€“ there was some context, we had to
						solve for various stresses, concentrations, iteratively choose
						components from McMaster that satisfied the design criteria as economically
						as possible, and create manufacturing drawings. Each of these projects
						has a significant amount of analysis to them, so I will give a brief
						overview of what was required and attach the assignment. Unfortunately
						due to the honor code I cannot attach my work in case a current student
						were to find it, but if you'd like to see it please email me and I'd
						be happy to send it to you. All three projects had a similar general
						context: you are an engineer working at a company that sells Pumps/Pump
						equipment. A pump system needs to be designed to remove water after
						flooding. Note: all figures shown are taken from the assignments.

						The focus of this problem was the pump support system. There is a motor
						that drives the pump with a belt, and the pump support could be
						in contact with water. Our goal was to design the pump platform,
						support arms, and choose clevis pins to connect these components to the fixed
						support structure. Among other specifications, we were given information
						about the speed and torque of the pump impeller shaft, the minimum
						tension in the belt, and the pump weight.

				The focus of this problem is the impeller shaft and the shaft components.
				The goal here was to select a shaft, key, set screw, bearings, retaining rings,
				and a tapered pin based on our analysis. Among other specifications, we were
				given information about the RPM and power transmission through the shaft,
				loads on the pulley, and loads from the impeller.

				The focus of this problem was on gear systems. We were given target RPM / power
				requirements for the shafts, a range of shaft diameters for each shaft, some
				spacing requirements, and other specifications. We had to select the gears
				based on the shaft size, kinematics, stresses and cost.

				Overall, I really enjoyed working on these problems. It felt like I was
				learning a useful skill and approach to design, and it has changed the way
				I see things.
