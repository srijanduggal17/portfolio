				During the summers of 2017 and 2018, I worked as an ACT/SAT tutor at a local
				business: The Power Courses. This was a 3-week long course that I went to as
				a high school student and it really helped my test scores. I really enjoy
				teaching; The previous summer I had taught math to 6th graders at
				Breakthrough New Orleans so I felt excited and capable to give back to the
				course. As a teacher, I learned a lot here about communication, motivation,
				and understanding when your students donâ€™t understand. During my time there,
				after many conversations with Alex Gershanik (the owner and head teacher), I
				found that his website needed improvement. I had an interest in web development
				from a previous project and thought creating a better website would be a great
				opportunity to learn and help. I organized and wrote the content for the site,
				set up times for another teacher (who was a fantastic photographer) to take pictures,
				and developed the site. It was my first time fully making a site from scratch and
				hosting it, so I learned a lot. I also made a desktop tool for easy upload of new
				course schedules every season. This is a great place to get standardized test prep
				and Alex is a great guy to work with! See screenshots and a demo below. Visit the
