				During my freshman year of college, my friends and I participated in a competition hosted by BMW. The goal was to design and prototype an end-effector for a robot to pick up automotive parts. We were a team of five and we started by brainstorming various ideas.

						In the actual competition, we made it past the design phase into the finalist round but then our device kind of stopped working. It was a spectacular failure, and we learned a lot of things about testing. One big mistake we made was not really checking the electrical requirements for all the chips and motors we purchased â€“ this caused us to fry some motor drivers along the way. Overall even though we made many mistakes, I learned a lot and thought it was a fun experience.
