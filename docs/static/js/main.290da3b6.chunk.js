This was the first time I had used any of my knowledge from Deformable Bodies class to an actual design, and it was pretty fun although I missed some things. I modeled each side as a cantilevered beam with the actuator\u2019s weight on it, and then I wrote a Python script for easy calculation with different tube parameters. The actual analysis is pretty brief and can be seen here."})})]})]})]})}function E(e){var t={maxHeight:"70vh",maxWidth:"100%"};return Object(a.jsxs)("div",{children:[Object(a.jsx)(y,{children:"Instrumented Insole"}),Object(a.jsxs)("div",{className:"w-100 container-fluid",children:[Object(a.jsxs)("div",{className:"row",children:[Object(a.jsx)("div",{className:"col-sm-4",children:Object(a.jsx)("img",{className:"pt-4 mx-auto pb-4 d-block",src:"project-assets/Instrumented Insole/Final Insole.jpg",style:t})}),Object(a.jsx)("div",{className:"col text-start fs-5 d-flex align-items-center pt-4",children:Object(a.jsx)("p",{children:"One idea that Dr. Young (my PI) and another professor, Dr. Mazumdar, were working on was a shoe insole that was instrumented with pressure sensors.
