Our work here is an attempted to create a gait phase estimator using a deep learning approach that uses sensors on the device and is robust to changes in terrain type / locomotion mode. The idea is that prior estimators have worked on individual locomotion modes, but from a practical standpoint, if a single estimator can be developed that works in all scenarios, then the system becomes much simpler. The benefits of a deep learning based approach are that no feature engineering is necessary: the model will take in the time-series data of various sensors on the exoskeleton and it will generate a single output estimate of the gait phase for each leg."}),Object(a.jsxs)("div",{className:"row",children:[Object(a.jsx)("div",{className:"col-sm-6",children:Object(a.jsx)("img",{className:"pt-4 mx-auto pb-4 d-block",src:"project-assets/Loc Agnostic GP Est/Exo and Terrain Park.png",style:t})}),Object(a.jsx)("div",{className:"col text-start fs-5 d-flex align-items-center pt-4",children:Object(a.jsx)("p",{children:"Here you can see the device we used and the various aspects of it.

The model architecture we used was compared to a conventional time-based method for estimating gait phase (TBE). The TBE method works by using the average time between heel contacts and the current time since a heel contact to compute the gait phase. The results from the time-based method are shown in red, and the results from our method are shown in blue. Each of the four strips shows time series plots of the gait phase percentage and the resulting commanded torque profiles for various locomotion modes and mode transitions. The RMSE for the specific mode/mode transition is listed at the top of each cell. The ground truth gait phase percentage and corresponding profiles are shown in grey. What is really cool here is that our model created very smooth estimates of gait phase and smooth assistance profiles, in transition steps as well. This is in contrast with the time-based method, which produced jerky profiles that would not feel natural at all to a user and certainly are not what is desired.
